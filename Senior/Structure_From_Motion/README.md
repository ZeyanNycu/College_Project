# Structure From Motion
Structure from motion(SFM) is a classic problem in computer vision. Given a several 2D images of an object from different views, we need to design an algorithm to reconstruct the appearance of the object in the three-dimensional world. Currently, traditional methods impose strict requirements on the photos taken. However, thanks to the power of deep learning, we can design a deep learning model to reduce the strict input requirements.
