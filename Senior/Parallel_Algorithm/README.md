# Parallel_Algorithm
Minimum spanning tree is a common tree. Thus, If we can successfully address this issue, we can gain significant benefits. We find three commonly used algorithms for solving MST tasks including Kruskal, Prim, and Bor≈Øvka algorithms and evaluate them on three different kinds of dataset. In our experiments,we demonstrated the successful parallelization of three algorithms.and conducted
an analysis on each of them.
