# Image Stitching
In this project, I would follow the following pipeline to stitch image seamlessly.
* Detecting key point(feature) on the images
* Finding features correspondences (feature matching)
* Computing homography matrix
* Stitching image (warp images into same coordinate system)
## Used Skill
The following are the skill that I used in this project:
* SIFT algorithm
* Feature matching (KNN)
* Construct homography matrix. (RANSAC)
* Blending
